# Statistical Models Exploration in R and Python

Welcome to my repository! This project is dedicated to a deep dive into statistical models such as **Poisson**, **Normal**, and other fundamental statistical distributions. The code is written in both **R** and **Python** to provide a dual approach to statistical modeling.

## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a **Master's in Data and Computational Science** with a passion for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My background includes a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science Engineering, research in precision agriculture, and various data-centric projects. I enjoy working with data, exploring complex statistical concepts, and applying computational methods to derive meaningful results.

## Project Overview
This repository serves as an educational resource and codebase for statistical model exploration. Each section covers a unique model, diving into theory, real-world applications, and practical code implementation in both **R** and **Python**. Below is a summary of what's included:

## **Poisson Distribution**: 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, everyone! Iâ€™m excited to share the first part of my journey into statistical modeling. In this GitHub repository, Iâ€™m exploring the Poisson Distribution in-depth with R.

### ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside?

The Poisson Distribution is foundational in statistics for modeling discrete events, particularly useful in scenarios where we want to predict the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval (like the number of calls received at a call center or the number of website hits in a minute). This project covers:

- Theory: Key concepts behind the Poisson Distribution, including lambda (Î»), expected value, and variance.
- Code Implementation: Practical coding examples in both R
