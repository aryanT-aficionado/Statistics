## Mood, Weather, and Shopping Probability: A Logistic Regression Analysis
#### Overview
This project explores the fascinating interplay between mood, weather conditions, and the probability of making a decision to go shopping. Using a logistic regression model, we quantify how mood levels and weather influence the likelihood of stepping out for errands like grocery shopping.

The project is inspired by real-world scenarios where external factors like weather can heavily influence our daily decisions. For instance, with snow or rain in the forecast, does your mood—and subsequently your decision to venture out—change?

#### Key Features
- Weather-Behavior Analysis: Understand how different weather conditions (Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, Sunny) influence shopping behavior.
- Mood-Driven Predictions: Quantify the relationship between mood levels and the probability of stepping out.
- Interactive Visualization: A clean and intuitive graph demonstrates the relationship between mood, weather, and shopping probability.

#### Highlights
The visualization shows that the predicted probability of shopping based on mood levels (0–100) across four weather conditions:

- Cloudy: Moderate influence.
- Rainy: Strong deterrent to shopping.
- Snowy: Noticeable drop in shopping likelihood.
- Sunny: Positive influence, with higher probabilities at higher mood levels.
